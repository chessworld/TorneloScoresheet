## Move type

Represents a chess move

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Move = PartialMove & {
    color: Color;
    flags: string;
    piece: PieceSymbol;
    san: string;
    captured?: PieceSymbol;
};
```

## Remarks

The `piece`<!-- -->, `captured`<!-- -->, and `promotion` fields contain the lowercase representation of the applicable piece.

The `flags` field in verbose mode may contain one or more of the following values:

- `n` - a non-capture

- `b` - a pawn push of two squares

- `e` - an en passant capture

- `c` - a standard capture

- `p` - a promotion

- `k` - kingside castling

- `q` - queenside castling

A flag of `pc` would mean that a pawn captured a piece on the 8th rank and promoted.
