# Recording

The recording screen allows you to record the moves of your game.

Record a move by dragging a piece from it's source square to it's destination square.

You can skip either players move by recording two moves in a row for a player.

## Action Buttons

Along the side of the board is a list of buttons that do the following actions:

- Flip: Flip the perspective of the board to be from the opposite side of the board
- End: End the game. This will ask you to specify who won, and prompt each player to sign
- Time: Add a time to the most recent move
- Draw: Toggle a draw offer on the most recent move
- Skip: Skip the current player's move
- Undo: Undo the last move

## Move history

As moves are recorded, they will appear in the move history below the board.

Moves can be edited by pressing and holding on them in the move history. This allows you
to toggle a draw offer, edit the timing information of the move, or edit the move itself.

Editing the move will show the source and destination squares as highlighted on the board,
and will not allow you to make edits that will make future moves impossible.

When editing a move, the action buttons along the side of the board change:

- Cancel: Cancel editing the move, and leave it as it was before begining the edit
- Flip: Flip the perspective of the board to be from the opposite side of the board
- Skip: Replace the moving being edited with a skip
- Reset: TODO
- Undo: TODO
