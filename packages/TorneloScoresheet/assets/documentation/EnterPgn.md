# Select Even Screen

This screen is used to specify which tournament the app is currently being used at.
The previous event is saved and the Arbiter can choose to continue with the same event.

If the Arbiter wishes to change the event, they should:

- Log in to the Tornelo Dashboard on another device
- Navigate to the tournament that the app is currently being used at
- Click "Scoresheet QR code", a QR code should be displayed
- Click "Edit Event" on this screen
- Scan the QR code to switch to another event
- If this does not work or the Arbiter wishes to change values manually, they can select "Text mode" to input the data manually.

The arbiter can view past games from this screen by switching modes using the toggle mode button in the toolbar.
