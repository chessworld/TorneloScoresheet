# Arbiter Recording

This page allows the arbiter to view all the past moves as well as their legality.

The moves are visible in the table and are colour coded to represent differing legality statuses:

- A Blue move means that move is in repetition, all other instances of that repetition are also in Blue
- An orange move indicates a check mate
- A grey move represents a stalemate
- A Yellow move represents a draw

The arbiter can return to previous game modes by switching modes using the toggle mode button in the toolbar.
