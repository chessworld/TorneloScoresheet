# Quality Assurance Plan

## Approach


## Testing


## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment


## Definition Of Done

The definition of done for any task is met when the following are complete:

* All the work meets the requirements specified on the Trello ticket
* A pull request has been made and approved by another team member
* Any relevant documentation has been completed.
* A description of the task, acceptance criteria, and the outcome is available on the Trello ticket

If the Trello ticket is code based, the following additional requirements need to be met:

* All code is functional and passes the CI/CD pipeline
* Any relevant test cases have been written
* The code is commented such that another developer on the team can understand what it does by reading it.
* The code has the correct syntax for the language being used, and syntax is consistent across the entire code base.
* All code has undergone testing (black box, integration, system or acceptance depending on what the deliverable is)	
* The Trello ticket contains a link to the pull request 
* The branch has been merged into main and deleted

When all the relevant points above have been fulfilled, the Trello ticket can be closed.

## Code Review

All Pull Requests for the project are to be reviewed before being merged.

The Code Review process involves the following:
1. The author demonstrates and describes the code to the reviewer
2. The reviewer asks questions about the code
3. The reviewer identifies issues

After the code is reviewed either:
- The code is merged
- The merge is declined
- Minor changes are made and the code is rereviewed
