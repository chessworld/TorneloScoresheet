## Sprint Planning Methodology

### Sprint Planning
0. Create project stories, (if after inception, should only be from sprint retro)
    1. Tasks that will/might improve the project's maintainability
    2. Example: CI, management process updates, build environment changes, documentation needs, etc.
2. Meet with product owner to generate stories
    1. Assign level of priority to each story
    2. Ensure each story card card has acceptance criterias
    3. Include caveats and details in each story card
3. Break each story into tasks
    1. Identify blocking tasks (i.e. prevents progress of another task)
    2. Estimate the amonut of work for each task - call them `story points`
    3. Add up the total `story point`s for each epic
    4. Save tasks and epics in the backlog.
    5. `Note:` If a non-priority task blocks a high priority task, that task should be set to a `Blocking` priority.
    6. Not every epic/story needs to be broken down to tasks, only the high priority ones first. Time estimates may change as we move on to future sprints.
4. Assigns tasks to be done to current sprint.
    1. Estimate the amount of time that the team can work on this project.
    2. Ensure that everyone has something they **can** work on for the sprint.
    3. Priorities blocking tickets first, especially if they block other high-priority tickets.
    4. If incomplete tickets from the previous sprint are not complete
        1. If it blocks tasks from the current sprint, move it to the current sprint
        2. If the ticket priority drops for some reason (client or otherwise), return ticket to backlog.
5. Assign owners to each of the tasks in the sprint.
    1. Each team member will provide an estimated number of hours of availability
    2. The scrum master will go through each ticket and assign up to two team members
    3. Team members will check the number of story points assigned to them and ensure it lines up with their availability during the sprint
    4. If a team member has too many/few story points from the sprint tickets are re-allocated as needed.

Story points table for reference:
| Story points | Description                                                                 | Time estimate |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1            | Answering a question, quick investigation                                   | < 30 mins     |
| 2            | Copy text / very minor code edits                                           | < 1 hour      |
| 3            | Extensive docs / minor code edits                                           | < 3 hours     |
| 5            | Substantial work, like a sub-feature                                        | < 1 day       |
| 8            | Substantial work, with potentially unknown technology                       | < 2 days      |
| 13           | Too big, like a full feature. Break down the task or convert it to an epic. | Full sprint   |


NOTES:
* 3i exists for **when** (not **if**) the team's time commitment changes. We are all uni students with shifting priorities.
* Despite having less "estimated work time", two tasks with 2 story points can be more costly than a task with 3 story points. Switching between tasks tend to take time in the **transition**. Context switching is expensive.

### During Sprints

For each individual team member:
1. Work on an assigned ticket.
3. Once the ticket is complete, put it through the review process
    1. Ticket reviews are NOT tasks. (trust me, it will get stupidly messy if you do this)
    2. Review other peoples' tasks in your own time. If you feel a writer's block, or if you just want an ego boost for the day. This happens more often than you think.
4. Refer to QAP for more detail.

### Sprint Retrospective

Sprint retros are to be done immediately before the **next sprint planning** session. This helps in keeping the `what needs to be improved` ideas fresh. If anything needs to be improved, we create tickets accordingly. (See Sprint planning 1.1)
