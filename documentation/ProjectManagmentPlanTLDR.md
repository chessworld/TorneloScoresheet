## Stakeholders
- Main Client
  - Tornelo team
- Licensing
  - World Chess Federation
- End Users
  - Chess tournament contestants
  - Chess tournament invigilators & arbitrers

## Sprint Planning Methodology

### Sprint Planning
0. Populate backlog according to requirements discussed with the client.
    1. The backlog is subject to change if requested by the client, but the FIDE requirements for the app are unlikely to change signficantly.
    2. The client may add tickets to the backlog which will be discussed with the team in weekly meetings.
    3. If any of the backlog tickets need to be further broken down this can be done in sprint planning.
2. Populate Sprint 
    1. Assign level of priority to each story
    2. Ensure each story card card has acceptance criterias
    3. Include caveats and details in each story card
    4. Identify blocking tasks (i.e. prevents progress of another task)
    5. Estimate the amonut of work for each task - call them `story points`
3. Assign owners to each of the tasks in the sprint.
    1. Each team member will provide an estimated number of hours of availability
    2. The scrum master will go through each ticket and assign up to two team members
    3. Team members will check the number of story points assigned to them and ensure it lines up with their availability during the sprint
    4. If a team member has too many/few story points from the sprint tickets are re-allocated as needed.
4. Review sprint with client 
    1. If the client wants a different ticket in the sprint the new ticket will be added 
    2. The client determines the priority of the tickets.

Story points table for reference:
| Story points | Description                                                                 | Time estimate |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1            | Answering a question, quick investigation                                   | < 30 mins     |
| 2            | Copy text / very minor code edits                                           | < 1 hour      |
| 3            | Extensive docs / minor code edits                                           | < 3 hours     |
| 5            | Substantial work, like a sub-feature                                        | < 1 day       |
| 8            | Substantial work, with potentially unknown technology                       | < 2 days      |
| 13           | Too big, like a full feature. Break down the task or convert it to an epic. | Full sprint   |


NOTES:
* 2i exists for **when** (not **if**) the team's time commitment changes. We are all uni students with shifting priorities.
* Despite having less "estimated work time", two tasks with 2 story points can be more costly than a task with 3 story points. Switching between tasks tend to take time in the **transition**. Context switching is expensive.

### During Sprints

For each individual team member:
1. Work on an assigned ticket.
3. Once the ticket is complete, put it through the review process
    1. Ticket reviews are NOT tasks.
    2. Review other peoples' tasks in your own time.
4. Refer to QAP for more detail.

### Sprint Retrospective

Sprint retros are to be done immediately before the **next sprint planning** session. This helps in keeping the `what needs to be improved` ideas fresh. If anything needs to be improved, we create tickets accordingly. (See Sprint planning 1.1)

## Team Management
The team is following a modified version of the Agile methodology. As such, there are three main roles being used: product owner, scrum master, and developer.
- Product Owner: David Cordover
- Scrum Master: Malo Hamon
- Stakeholder Manager: Llio Vernon
- Developer: All members in the team
