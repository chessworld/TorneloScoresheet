# Contributing Guidelines 
## Text Formatting
No pull request should be approved if it uses the <Text> component, all text should be formatted using <PrimaryText> which has been made to align with Tornelo branding.
  
## Style Formatting
All style components should be in a different file (excluding text styling which should be placed inline for ease of understanding).
  
## Return Values
Repeated HTML should be implemented as a different component.
