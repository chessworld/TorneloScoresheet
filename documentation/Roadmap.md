# Road Map

## MVP Goals/Mission Statement

The main goal of the MVP is to implement the required feature set to gain FIDE approval. The MVP will be missing key networking capabilities, and will mostly be a client-only, offline implementation. Thus, there wonâ€™t be much integration with existing Tornelo infrastructure - this can be saved for after FIDE approval.
At a high level, the goals of the MVP are:

- Client UI in line with existing Tornelo style guide
- Deployment to the App Store
- An implementation of the four modes outlined under [Business Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19exWTLiAAePttibcdCTFK4IwAxvoIlBbcELAI0gqwgA/edit#heading=h.e6rj1kl21bi7)
- Conformance with the FIDE guidelines
- Read from PGN (Potable Game Notation) to configure tournament
- Write to PGN when a move is made / ability to serialise game as PGN
